  Shardus is building the protocol layer software to enable application specific chains. We aim to remedy the problems of scalability, decentralization and efficiency. 
  Application specific chains built with Shardus will use dynamic state sharding and allow for global-scale decentralized networks. 
  The <a href="https://shardeum.org/" target=_blank>Shardeum</a> and <a href="https://liberdus.com" target=_blank>Liberdus</a> networks are being developed using this technology. What will you build with Shardus?
