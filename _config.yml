  Shardus is building distributed ledger software to remedy the problems of traditional blockchains — scalability, decentralization and efficiency. 
  The technology being developed will use compute and state sharding to accommodate billions of daily active users, allowing for global-scale decentralized networks. 
  The Shardeum and Liberdus networks will be launched using this technology.
