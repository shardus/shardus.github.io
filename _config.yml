  Shardus is building distributed ledger software to remedy the problems of traditional blockchains -- scalability, decentralization and efficiency. 
  The technology being developed will use compute and state sharding to accommodate billions of daily active users, allowing for global-scale decentralized applications. 
  The first application built with this technology will be a payment network and coin called Liberdus.
