  q: What is Shardus?
  a: Shardus is a project with a mission to develop technology for the public benefit. It's focus is on advancing distributed ledger technology. The software developed by Shardus will be the foundation for global-scale decentralized networks. The Shardus software can be used as a starting point for other public or private decentralized networks by adding a custom transaction layer. Decentralized application which are built using Shardus will inherit many features including scalability, decentralization, effiency and sustainability. Applications built using Shardus will scale to accommodate more throughput as demand grows, simply by adding more nodes to the network.
